# Mushroom Platformer Game

A simple 2D platform game created for Sumo Digital's Diversity Internship Training Programme. 

Use your character (he's a fun guy) to jump through the clouds to collect the fallen stars and return them home to their place in the sky. Watch out for the hungry snails that might just take a bite out of you if you get too close.

# Game features
Collect all the stars before reaching the flag. 

Colliding with snails will cost you a life. But jumping on their shells will send them to... the other side.

Running off the side of the screen will put you at the other side (this may come in handy). 

Jumping on a jumppad will give you a boost to reach high platforms.
