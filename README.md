# Mushroom Platformer Game

A simple 2D platform game created for Sumo Digital's Diversity Internship Training Programme. 

Use your character (he's a fun guy) to jump through the clouds to collect the fallen stars and return them home to their place in the sky. Watch out for the hungry snails that might just take a bite out of you if you get too close.
